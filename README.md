Hello,

I developed an interactive computer website with the help of Claude. This is still work in progress and very basic but the contains the element of looking at a computer and being able to click and view on
the components that make a PC.

1. Everything is located in the src file if you would like to run it locally.
2. Here is the Vercel link if you would like to do a quick visit.

Enjoy!
